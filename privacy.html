                                        app is running in the foreground or background of your device. This
                                        information may be used to help you select your delivery address, to

                                        improve the services. You can choose whether to enable the location

                                        prompted by the TowGig mobile app. If you choose to disable the location
                                        feature, the service provider(expert) will not receive precise location

                                        users to invite friends and family to sign up for our Services. Sometimes
                                        we offer a promotional value for every friend or family member who signs
                                        up and places an order through your referral link. To help you do this, we
                                        may request you to grant us access to your mobile device address book.
                                        You can then direct us to send referral emails to contacts you select in
                                        your address book. By sending a referral, you also consent to TowGig
                                        sending your public profile image to the contacts you select to receive a
                                        referral link. By choosing to invite a friend you represent that you have
                                        received the friend’s consent to provide his or her name and email address
                                        with us. TowGig will use that information to send an email or any mean of
                                        inviting him or her to visit the site and will store that information to track the
                                        success of the referral program and may send marketing emails. You can
                                        also send an SMS with a referral link to your contacts. If you use this
                                        option, you understand that TowGig does not control the timing, content, or

                                        <p class="htwp-p mt-2"><strong>Why user background location is needed:</strong> TowGig Technologies, is an ondemand service providing platform that is mainly running
                                            on location based service providing system. The platform is built to accommodate 2
                                            types of parties. The buyer who's seeking service, and expert, who's providing services.
                                            The job assignment algorithm is based upon distance between the buyer and expert.
                                            Hence, the background location feature is needed, because when a buyer request a job,
                                            the algorithm calculate the distance between the buyer seeking service and alert all the
                                            service providers within a given radius.
                                            When our algorithm hit the experts current location it then return to our system(server)
                                            to calculate the distance between the buyer and expert on the basis of live locations
                                            between both users. The system then decide what expert to assign the job to. The expert
                                            after accepting the job, move to the buyer's exact location to perform the task.
                                            For this entire process to be accurate and effective both users are recommended to allow
                                            the background location feature in the app for better delivery experience.
                                            Therefore, without the background location system, TowGig app, is completely
                                            redundant.</p>
